# AmazonTask

Project Overview
This project contains automated test scripts for Amazon's "Today's Deals" page. The test automates the process of navigating the deals section, applying specific filters, and interacting with listed products. It demonstrates best practices in coding standards, design patterns, and includes data-driven testing scenarios. Additionally, due to the dynamic nature of web interactions, a manual intervention might be required for CAPTCHAs if they appear during automated sessions. This integration ensures the tests are robust yet acknowledge potential manual steps to maintain the flow of automation.
